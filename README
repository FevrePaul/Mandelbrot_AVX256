####### Mandelbrot optimisations CPP #######

This is a school project aiming to teach us single threaded optimisations.

Thanks to AVX256 we can optimise our mandelbrot without using more than one thread.

We compare the result with the use of threads AND AVX256. For the threads I used the TBB library.



####### To test it #######

mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release; make; ./bench

The bench will test the program with threads and without threads.
